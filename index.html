        NEW YORK — Coronavirus deaths exceeded <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/world/covid-1-million-deaths.html">one million worldwide this September</a>—just 10 months since the first COVID-19 cases were reported in China. In the United
        States,
        there have been over <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map">200,000 COVID-19 deaths and over 7 million cases.</a>

        <br />
        <br />
        COVID-19 is a virus that mainly spreads from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">person-to-person</a> through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs,
        sneezes, or talks. A person can get infected by inhaling these droplets or touching surfaces that have
        the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. The best way to prevent getting sick is to avoid exposure to the virus.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here are three things the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC recommends</a> you can do to protect yourself and others from getting infected:
        <br />
        <br />

      </p>


      <h2>Wash Your Hands Often</h2>

        <p>
          Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after being in a public space, before eating, and after blowing your nose. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Studies show that washing hands reduces
          respiratory illnesses in the general population by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/why-handwashing.html#five">16-21%.</a>
        </p>

      <h2>Avoid Close Contact</h2>

        <img src=images/noun_distance_3437711.png width="100px" height="100px" />

        <P>
          When in a public space, stand 6-feet apart from anyone that does not live in your household. According to a professor of Medicine at UC San Diego, an infected person would only infect on average 15 people in 30 days, if
          social contact was reduced by 75 percent. Without any changes one infected person could on average lead to <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/21198/effect-of-social-distancing-signer-lab/">406 infected cases in 30 days.</a>
        </P>

      <h2>Wear a Mask</h2>
      <div class="boxes" id="box3">
        <img src=images/noun_facemask_3381791.png width="100px" height="100px" />

        <p>
          Wear a mask that covers both your mouth and nose when in public or near anyone who doesn't live in your household. The mask protects others in case you are
          infected by preventing respiratory droplets from spreading into the air. A study by the <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent">University of Iowa</a> found
          that when states mandated masks, the daily COVID-19 growth rate would be slowed by 0.9 percentage-points after 5 days. Three
          weeks after masks mandates were implemented the daily growth rate slowed by 2 percentage-points.
